When landing on the homepage, you have to choose between two options : you click either at the left side of the window to 'Generate your MoodBoard' with keywords and with the possibility to sort images by colors and by numbers, 
either you click on the right side to 'Find Inspirations' by scrolling through an (almost) infinite list of images in order for you to find inspirations and ideas to create your own MoodBoard.
